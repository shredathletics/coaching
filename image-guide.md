# How to Add Images to Your Shred Athletics Website

If you're seeing placeholder boxes instead of images on your website, follow these steps to add your images correctly:

## Step 1: Prepare Your Images

1. Find the team photo you want to use
2. Find a headshot or action photo of the coach
3. Make sure both images are in JPG format
4. Resize them if needed (coach image works best at around 400x400 pixels)

## Step 2: Name Your Files Correctly

The website is looking for these exact filenames:
- `Team.JPG` (note the uppercase JPG)
- `coach.jpg` (lowercase jpg)

## Step 3: Place the Files in the Right Location

1. Put both image files in the same folder as your `index.html` file
2. Make sure they're not in a subfolder

## Step 4: Replace Any Placeholder Files

If there are existing placeholder files with these names:
1. Delete the current `Team.JPG` and `coach.jpg` files
2. Add your new image files with the exact same names

## Step 5: Test Your Website

1. Refresh your website in the browser
2. The images should now appear in place of the placeholders

## Troubleshooting

If images still don't appear:
- Check that the filenames match exactly (including uppercase/lowercase)
- Make sure the files are actual image files, not text files
- Try using different image files to rule out file corruption
- Clear your browser cache and reload the page
